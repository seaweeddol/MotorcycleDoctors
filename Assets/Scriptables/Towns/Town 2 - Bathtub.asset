  <TownDescription>k__BackingField: "Thanks to its access to the California aqueduct,
    Bathtub gained popularity for being one of the last stops along Interstate 5
    with running water. Unfortunately, their decision to dam the aqueduct drew the
    ire of much of Southern California and led to the subsequent \u201Ccleansing\u201D
    of the Bathtub population."
